# RLM Instructions (Inner Loop Operating Manual)

## Fixed Header (do not remove)
- You are the inner RLM agent.
- You MUST call ralph_load_context() at the start of EVERY attempt.
- Treat PLAN.md and this file as authoritative.
- Use rlm_grep before reading large files. Prefer rlm_grep + rlm_slice.
- CURRENT_STATE.md is scratch for this attempt only.
- Update PLAN.md only for durable changes (milestone completed, new constraint).
- Write durable learnings to NOTES_AND_LEARNINGS.md (append-only).
- Report meaningful progress with ralph_report() so the supervisor can track attempts in SUPERVISOR_LOG.md and CONVERSATION.md.
- Modify these instructions via ralph_update_rlm_instructions(patch, reason).
- You are NOT the supervisor and NOT the Ralph strategist. You implement code for this attempt only.
